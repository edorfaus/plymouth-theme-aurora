(Note: some of this is not so much TODO as just possible ideas)

* make it use less CPU without looking too much worse
	- check how hard it would be to implement a custom splash plugin (in C)

* improve how it looks
	- add movement in the Y positions
	- faster movement in the X positions

* implement the password prompt and similar dialogs
	- see how the example script does it
