This is a Plymouth theme (based on the script module) that shows a moving
aurora on a starfield, along with the system's logo.

This currently includes and uses a logo for AuroraOS[1] since that's what the
theme was built for and the system I was testing on hadn't set the system logo
for Plymouth (since it didn't use Plymouth itself). However, the code to use
the system logo is in there, just commented out, and should be obvious.

There's quite a few settings at the top of the script, that can be used for
tuning the theme for your system - I've tried to minimize CPU usage while still
having it look decent, as it's meant (at least in part) for netbooks.

To install it, simply place the aurora dir in the Plymouth themes dir (usually
/usr/share/plymouth/themes/ or /lib/plymouth/themes/ ).


On Ubuntu, the theme also needs to be added to alternatives before it can be
selected, using this command:

sudo update-alternatives --install /lib/plymouth/themes/default.plymouth default.plymouth /lib/plymouth/themes/aurora/aurora.plymouth 100

Then, you can choose which theme to use with these commands:

sudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth
sudo update-initramfs -u
